#Introduction
This repository showcases a Bank churn prediction analysis using a variety of machine learning models. Churn prediction involves identifying customers who are likely to leave a service or product, which helps businesses take proactive measures to retain them.

Features
Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling continuous features.

Class imbalance handling: Using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset.

Model training: Training Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest models.

Threshold optimization: Using cross-validation to find the best threshold for each model based on F1-score.

Model evaluation: Evaluating model performance on training, validation, and test data.

Visualization: Creating visualizations for feature distributions, confusion matrices, and evaluation metrics.

Results
The analysis provides insights into Bank customer churn prediction using various machine learning models. Results include:

Visualizations of feature distributions.
Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for each model on training, validation, and test data.
Confusion matrices illustrating model predictions on the test data.
Comparison of F1-scores across models.
